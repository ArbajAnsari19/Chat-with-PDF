An AI-powered application designed to answer questions based on the content of PDF files.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have downloaded and extracted the necessary files.

## Installation

1. Download the required folders from the following links:

   - [Link 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v_XSr8ueSuAGAtahEpftnATrODMP1vaK/view?usp=sharing)

2. Clone this repository or download it to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/PDF-Answering-AI


4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/PDF-Answering-AI
   ```


5. Extract the downloaded zip file into the project directory:
   ```
   unzip path/to/downloaded_file.zip -d .
   ```
Note: Replace `path/to/downloaded_file.zip` with the actual path to your downloaded zip file.

## Usage
Download the required packages through following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the application, use the following command: 
```
streamlit run main.py
```


This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

After extraction, your project structure should look like this:
PDF-Answering-AI/
│
├── main.py
├── [other project files]
│
└── [extracted folder]/
└── [required files and folders]

Ensure that the extracted folder is placed directly in the project directory.


  
Note: InfereSent is a package which is used to create Sentence Embeddings and I have included it in the repository itself so no need to download it.
